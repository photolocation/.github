## The Story Behind GeoSpy

I've always been fascinated by travel photographs - those captivating images that transport us to different parts of the world. During a backpacking trip through Europe, I found myself looking through old photos from my grandmother's travels in the 1970s. Many were unlabeled, leaving me wondering where these beautiful places were.

That's when the idea for GeoSpy was born. I wanted to create a tool that could analyze architectural styles, natural landscapes, and cultural elements to identify where photos were taken. Not just for my own collection, but for everyone who's ever found an intriguing photo and wondered "where in the world is this?"

Now, whenever I'm playing geographic guessing games with friends or trying to identify locations from social media photos, GeoSpy has become our go-to tool. It's turned into both a practical utility and a fun game - sometimes we deliberately remove the location metadata from our travel photos and challenge each other to see if GeoSpy can identify the location before we can!

## How to Use GeoSpy

Using GeoSpy is simple and completely free:

1. **Upload Your Image**: Click or drag-and-drop your photo onto the upload area.
